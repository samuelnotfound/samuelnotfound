# Hey there, I'm Sam! ðŸ‘‹ 

I have no background in coding, I initially made this account just to share my Hackintosh [related help](https://github.com/unitedastronomer/miscellaneous-hackintosh-guides), and [config](https://github.com/unitedastronomer/E1-572G-Hackintosh), but now I got into doing rive animations, so I'm now here just to host my work through GitHub.io pages!

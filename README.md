# Hey there, I'm Sam! ðŸ‘‹ 

I have no background in coding, I initially made this account just to share some Hackintosh [related help](https://github.com/unitedastronomer/miscellaneous-hackintosh-guides), and [config](https://github.com/unitedastronomer/E1-572G-Hackintosh). I recently started learning how to create Rive animations, so now I'm here just to host my work through GitHub Pages!

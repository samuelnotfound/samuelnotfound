# Hey there, I'm Sam! ðŸ‘‹ 

I have no coding background, I initially made this account just to share some [Hackintosh related help](https://github.com/unitedastronomer/miscellaneous-hackintosh-guides). I recently got into doing rive animations, so I'm now here just to host my work through GitHub.io pages!
